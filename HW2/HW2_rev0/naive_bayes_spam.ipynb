The pre-processing ensures that only the email body and subject remain in the dataset; email addresses (EMAILADDR), web addresses (HTTPADDR), currency (DOLLAR) and numbers (NUMBER) were also replaced by special tokens to allow them to be considered properly in the classiﬁcation process. If you are interested in the pre-processing, two examples for spam emails and their pre-processed forms and one example for a non-spam email and its pre-processed form are in the folder *samples\\_FYI*.\n",

(Examples: tokens that occur very often are terms like “the,” “and,” and “of,” which occur in any spam and non-spam emails.) Also, terms were stemmed using a standard stemming algorithm; basically, this means that “price,” “prices” and “priced” have all been replaced with “price,” so that they can be treated as the same token. For a list of the tokens used, see the ﬁle *TOKENS_LIST.txt* in the *samples\\_FYI* folder. \n",
