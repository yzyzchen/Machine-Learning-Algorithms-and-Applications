    "**Notice**: There is NO EXTRA CODE for you to implement in this section. You can directly reuse your code that you implemented in section(A) and (B).

Therefore, please start doing this **AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE**. \n",

The stories can be **imperfect** because we are only running a small model, but it should generate real words mostly, and follow grammar rules to some extent. Don't worry if the story is longer than the maximum length(1024 chars). Feel free to run it for longer (increase max_iters) or make the model size larger if you have time and want better results, but the default setting should be good enough. "
